## Playwright MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.

### Key Features

- **Fast and lightweight**: Uses Playwright's accessibility tree, not pixel-based input.
- **LLM-friendly**: No vision models needed, operates purely on structured data.
- **Deterministic tool application**: Avoids ambiguity common with screenshot-based approaches.

### Use Cases

- Web navigation and form-filling
- Data extraction from structured content
- Automated testing driven by LLMs
- General-purpose browser interaction for agents

### Example config

#### NPX

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Installation in VS Code

Install the Playwright MCP server in VS Code using one of these buttons:

<!--
// Generate using?:
const config = JSON.stringify({ name: 'playwright', command: 'npx', args: ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"] });
const urlForWebsites = `vscode:mcp/install?${encodeURIComponent(config)}`;
// Github markdown does not allow linking to `vscode:` directly, so you can use our redirect:
const urlForGithub = `https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=${encodeURIComponent(urlForWebsites)}`;
-->

Alternatively, you can install the Playwright MCP server using the VS Code CLI:

```bash
# For VS Code
code --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}'
```

```bash
# For VS Code Insiders
code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}'
```

After installation, the Playwright MCP server will be available for use with your GitHub Copilot agent in VS Code.

### CLI Options

The Playwright MCP server supports the following command-line options:

- `--browser <browser>`: Browser or chrome channel to use. Possible values:
  - `chrome`, `firefox`, `webkit`, `msedge`
  - Chrome channels: `chrome-beta`, `chrome-canary`, `chrome-dev`
  - Edge channels: `msedge-beta`, `msedge-canary`, `msedge-dev`
  - Default: `chrome`
- `--caps <caps>`: Comma-separated list of capabilities to enable, possible values: tabs, pdf, history, wait, files, install. Default is all.
- `--cdp-endpoint <endpoint>`: CDP endpoint to connect to
- `--executable-path <path>`: Path to the browser executable
- `--headless`: Run browser in headless mode (headed by default)
- `--port <port>`: Port to listen on for SSE transport
- `--user-data-dir <path>`: Path to the user data directory
- `--vision`: Run server that uses screenshots (Aria snapshots are used by default)

### User data directory

Playwright MCP will launch the browser with the new profile, located at

```
- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile` on Windows
- `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile` on macOS
- `~/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile` on Linux
```

All the logged in information will be stored in that profile, you can delete it between sessions if you'd like to clear the offline state.


### Running headless browser (Browser without GUI).

This mode is useful for background or batch operations.

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--headless"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Running headed browser on Linux w/o DISPLAY

When running headed browser on system w/o display or from worker processes of the IDEs,
run the MCP server from environment with the DISPLAY and pass the `--port` flag to enable SSE transport.

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931
```

And then in MCP client config, set the `url` to the SSE endpoint:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8931/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker

**NOTE:** The Docker implementation only supports headless chromium at the moment.
```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--init", "mcp/playwright"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool Modes

The tools are available in two modes:

1. **Snapshot Mode** (default): Uses accessibility snapshots for better performance and reliability
2. **Vision Mode**: Uses screenshots for visual-based interactions

To use Vision Mode, add the `--vision` flag when starting the server:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--vision"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Vision Mode works best with the computer use models that are able to interact with elements using
X Y coordinate space, based on the provided screenshot.

### Build with Docker

You can build the Docker image yourself.
```
docker build -t mcp/playwright .
```

### Programmatic usage with custom transports

```js
import http from 'http';

import { createServer } from '@playwright/mcp';
import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';

http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  // ...

  // Creates a headless Playwright MCP server with SSE transport
  const mcpServer = await createServer({ headless: true });
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
  await mcpServer.connect(transport);

  // ...
});

```
